# Open Source Contribution

## IH NG Packages

Hi, this is **Idnan Haider** (IH) a senior software engineer, Angular Lead, and JS full stack developer. Problem-solving is what excites me. I was providing generic solutions for regular web application features and libraries since 2018 for different companies. Now I have decided to contribute to the open-source community so we can make someone's life easier.

I'll be adding some Angular libraries. Helpful and easy to use.
As Angular Material is first-party, I'll be adding features that are not available directly into Angular material. although I'll be using Angular material in the core.

Here are a few names:

- Web Notification Message | Toaster
- Dynamic & Responsive Data Table
- Dynamic Form Renderer
- Dynamic Navigation Bar
- Dynamic Pipe
- Helper Module for Custom Directives of different types
  - Text ellipse
  - Masking
  - If Permitted
  - and a couple of other helper directives
